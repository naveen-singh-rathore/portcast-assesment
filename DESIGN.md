## Billing periods

"Monthly" means calendar month, UTC. A period is identified by `YYYY-MM`: it starts at
00:00 UTC on the 1st and ends (exclusive) at 00:00 UTC on the 1st of the next month.

The period id will be part of every counter key, so a new month writes to new keys:
there is no reset job, so nothing can run late or run twice.

Naive datetimes are rejected rather than assumed UTC: a wrong guess near midnight on the
last day of a month would charge usage to the wrong month.

Rejected: rolling 30 days (needs per-event history, expensive, confusing to customers);
per-org anchor dates (only needed if billing cycles differ; `period_for()` is the single
function to change).
